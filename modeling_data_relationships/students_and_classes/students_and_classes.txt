Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken.
The model should include the students' grades for a given class.

1. What classes/entities do we need to model?

  We need to store student and class information, and we need to store the grades
  a student receives for every class.

2. What fields/attributes will each enitity need?
  I will assume this database is for a university, so no information on parents is
  required.

  Student:
    * first name
    * last name
    * id (PK)
    * student email address
    * physical address
    * phone

  Class:
    * id (PK)
    * subject
    * building
    * room number

  It doesn't make sense to store the grade in either the student model or the class
  model. Students have a grade for every class. Also, students can enroll into the
  same class multiple times. So a third enitity, called enrollment, will be used to
  connect a student to a class.

  Enrollment:
    * id
    * grade
    * student_id (FK)
    * class_id (FK)
    * term

3. What data types do we need to use?
  Integers for the id's as usual. Strings will be used for everything else. Even
  room numbers to allow for unconventional rooms such as "1A"

4. What relationships exist between entities?
  There will be a one-to-many relationship between the student and an enrollment,
  and between the class and enrollment.

5. How should those relationships be represented in tables?
  See the students_and_classes.sql file.
