2. A database might be used when there is a loarge collection of data and/or when
multiple applications are trying to access that data. Text files are good when
only a single application accesses it at a time such as configuration files for
a video game.

3. SQL is declarative, so we just tell the database what we want without worrying
about how the database engine is going to retrieve it.

4. The database language lets us talk to the database engine through queries, and
the engine can read, manipulate, or remove data from the database depending on the
queries we send it.

5. A table is the structure that relational databases use to lay out the data. Each
table contains the data in rows and columns. Each column contains one type of data
and the column name describes what the data represents. Each row makes up a complete
conceptual unit, sort of like multiple instances of a class from other programming
languages. Values sit at the intersections of rows and columns and they are the
actual data that the column name describes.

The first query SELECTs the date and amount columns from the payments table. It returns
a table with all of the data under those two columns.

The second query selects all of the amount data in the payments table that is greater
than 500. It returns a table with only one cell because only one value under amount
exists that is greater than 500.

The last query selects all columns in the payments table where the payee is eqal to
'Mega Foods'. The payments table conains only one such payee so it returns a table
with one row and all 4 columns.
